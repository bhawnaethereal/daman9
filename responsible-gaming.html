            <h1>Responsible Gaming</h1>
            <p>Hello friend, This message is not to stop you. It is just to say – play smart.</p>
            <p>Daman game is a game, yes, but it is also real money. So please use it with care.</p>
            <p>We want you to enjoy, not regret.</p>

            <h2>Game Is for Timepass, Not for Stress</h2>
            <p>Game should make you smile, not make you worry. If you are feeling low, tired or angry, do not open the
                app. Go outside, talk to someone, take rest.
            </p>
            <p>Do not think this game will solve money problems. Some win, some lose. That is normal.
            </p>

            <p>If you win – good. If you lose – stop. Try later or leave it.
            </p>

            <h2>Are You Playing Too Much? Just Think Once</h2>
            <p>Ask yourself:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Are you playing late at night every day?</li>
                <li>Are you missing study or work?</li>
                <li>Are you hiding it from family?</li>
                <li>Are you using money meant for other things?</li>
                <li>Are you getting angry when you lose?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If even 2 answers are yes, stop and take a break.</p>

            <h2>Play With Limit – Simple Rules to Follow</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Fix a time daily. Do not go beyond it.
                </li>
                <li>Keep money aside just for play. Small amount.</li>
                <li>Never take loan or borrow to play.</li>
                <li>Sleep properly. Eat properly.</li>
                <li>Keep balance in life. Game is not everything.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No one will stop you. But you must stop yourself when needed.
            </p>
